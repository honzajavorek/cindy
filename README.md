# Cindy

## Why

I like photos as JPEG files.
That's why I regularly AirDrop my photos from a phone to my computer, then sort them to albums, then back them up to external drives and else.
The task is easier with a tool which takes a bunch of photos and sorts them to directories by date when they were taken.

## Installation

Cindy only works with `exiftool` in the path.

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/honzajavorek/cindy.git
```

## Development

1.  You'll need [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
2.  Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:honzajavorek/cindy.git`
3.  Go to the project directory: `cd cindy`
4.  Install the project: `poetry install`

## Name

> The woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils.

Cindy is short of [Cinderella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella).
